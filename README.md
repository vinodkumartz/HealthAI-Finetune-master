## Medical Chat Doctor - Fine-Tuning with Domain-Specific Dataset

**Overview:**

This project focuses on preparing a domain-specific dataset and fine-tuning the LLaMA3 model to create a foundation for a Medical Chat Doctor. The model will be trained using the "ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100K" dataset from Hugging Face to ensure it can accurately interpret patient symptoms and provide relevant information.

**Current Progress:**

- **Dataset Preparation:** Preparing the "ChatDoctor-HealthCareMagic-100K" dataset for effective training.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning the LLaMA3 model on the prepared dataset to enhance its understanding and responsiveness to healthcare-related queries.

**Future Plans:**

- **Integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** To improve the accuracy and relevance of responses, RAG will be integrated to enhance the model's knowledge base dynamically.
- **User Interface Development:** Building an intuitive interface for seamless conversation, enabling easy access to medical advice through a virtual chat assistant.
